<li>
 Technological advancements will continue to accelerate.
 To an extent that it exceeds the human ability to adapt.
</li>

<li>
 This will accelerate the wealth inequality as owning
 hardware and software will increase in value while work will
 decrease in value.
</li>

<li>
 Governments will try to counter that by printing and borrowing
 money and giving it to the working class.
</li>

<li>
 This money will end up in the portfolios of the wealthy since the
 working class will not invest that money but spend it on goods and
 services sold by the wealthy, further increasing the wealth
 inequality and, thus, creating a vicious circle.
</li>

<li>
 The increase in money supply will eventually result in enough
 inflation that government controlled money will not be seen as
 a store of value anymore. People will switch to cryptocurrencies
 which cannot be created by a single country.
</li>

<li>
 Since the wealthy are - and will be - early adapters of crypto
 currencies, this will further increase wealth inequality.
</li>

<li>
 Democracy will start becoming a threat as due to
 their numbers, it gives huge power to angry and frustrated
 people.
</li>

<li>
 The wealthy will try to depower democracy and do enough 
 crowd control to keep peace. Installing kind of a
 world wide "tech government".
</li>

</ul>
